# WnCC-Assignment
This is done as a part of the convener selection process of WnCC

Task to be done: To scrape the web and display the top headlines from the tech section of any news website.

I approached it in 2 steps:
1. First, I used the Beautiful soup Python package for scraping a tech news website and display only the headlines. It is in the web_scraping.py file
2. Secondly, I used a popular API called newsAPI to print tech news of India from several websites.This is in the newsAPI.py file
